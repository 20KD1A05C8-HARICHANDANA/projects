                      <p>Alappuzha (Alleppey) is known as ‘the Venice of the East’. Offering the best tourist places in Alleppey, this charming place is the hub of Kerala’s backwaters and is home to a huge network of backwaters and more than thousand houseboats. The houseboats you find in the backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’, means living structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden days, kettuvallam or boat with a thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices.

The modern houseboats are equipped with all the comforts of a good hotel room like air conditioners, modern toilets, cozy living rooms, a kitchen and even a balcony for angling. An uninterrupted view of life in the backwaters fringed with coconut trees can be enjoyed from a houseboat. A perfect place to unwind with its laidback canals and lush greenery. The Alappuzha beach with a 137-year-old pier extending into the sea and an old 17th-century lighthouse built by the Portuguese add to the magic of the place. It is famous for its boat races, marine products, and coir industry.

So get ready to wander around this small but chaotic city center and bus-stand area, with its modest grid of canals. Head west to the beach or in practically any other direction towards the backwaters and Alleppey becomes elegant and greenery-fringed, waning into a watery world of hamlets, punted canoes, toddy shops and, of course, houseboats. Float along and gaze over paddy fields of succulent green, curvaceous rice barges and village life along the banks. Indeed, it is here that nature has spent upon the land her richest bounties. Come and explore the best tourist places in Alleppey.</p>

It is also called as the Gateway to Kerala and its awe inspiring scenic views makes it a perfect tourist destination. Kochi is small place in Kerala which is also known as God's Own Country and famous for its green pastures with beautiful landscapes.

                      The Origin of Kochi

Centuries ago Kochi was a commercial centre for traders like Arabs, British, Portuguese Dutch and Chinese. These travelers came to this beautiful city to get access to spices like cardamom, clove and black pepper which was abundantly available here. These trading activities greatly contributed to the development and growth of this small city. Thus, it got its name The Gateway to Kerala. With such rapid commercialization it attracted Portuguese, E English and Dutch to set up bases in this city. During the reign of the Portuguese (1530 A.D) a fort known as 'Manuel Kotta' or Fort Emmanuel was built.

The Dutch came in later by 1653 and they managed to succeed over the Portuguese by 1663. Mysore emperors like Ali Haider and Tipu Sultan had defeated the Dutch but alas they were not successful with the British. Later in 1814 Dutch signed an agreement known as Anglo-Dutch treaty with the British wherein Kochi was traded for Bangka Island in Indonesia. After getting Independence from the British in 1947 the Travancore – Cochin state was established in 1949. In 1956, Kerala was formed by merging Kochi, Malabar and Travancore. After a thorough examination by the commission and after approval by the Kerala Legislative Assembly the Corporation of Cochin came into being in 1967.
Climate

Being very close to the equator, Kochi has a tropical monsoon. The temperatures range between 23-31°C. Summer season is in months of March to June where the highest temperature recorded at 35°C (95°F). During June and September this place experiences heavy showers and during October – December lighter rains can also be expected. Kochi gets an average rainfall of 3,228.3 mm which is greatly contributed by the south west monsoons.</p>

                      <p>The very first place which comes to our minds when we talk about the tourist places in Kerala is Munnar is beyond doubt. Let’s discuss some interesting and ‘not that much known’ facts about Munnar. Do you know the name ‘Munnar’ comes from 3 rivers? (In Malayalam ‘moonnu’ means 3 and ‘aaru’ means river). Yes, Munnar is a geographical confluence of three rivers which are, Kandala river, Nallathanni and Mudhirappuzha.

                      <p>Kollam (erstwhile Quilon) is a southern district of Kerala, located 70 km north of the state’s capital Thiruvananthapuram. It is flanked by the Arabian sea on the west, Tamil Nadu on the east, Alapuzha and Pathanamthitta districts on the north and Thiruvananthapuram district on the south. Housing a population of over 2.6 million, Kollam is one of the more densely peopled districts of India. The head quarters of the district administration is centred at Kollam City, the district’s capital. Administratively, the district is composed of two revenue divisions viz. Kollam and Punalur with three taluks each under them.

Like the rest of Kerala, Kollam is climactically temperate with a generally sunny weather peaking in heat during April-May. The monsoon falls from June to September. The soil is varyingly loamy, laterite and forest at the coastal regions, mainland and the forest areas respectively.

The heart land of Kollam is naturally veined by the Ashtamudi lake, a massive, multi-branched water body, which is also a popular boating attraction for tourists. This and the Kollam canal cutting through the city give Kollam a place of prominence in the waterway systems of the country. A number of islands of varying sizes beautifully spot the vast expanse of the lake. The city is graced by beaches where people go to spend quiet evenings. Kollam also has a considerably large forest cover on its eastern side making home for several eco tourism projects like Shenduruni, Thenmala, Palaruvi etc.

Kollam City boasts of a long history of political, commercial and cultural importance having found mention in several ancient travellers’ accounts.

                      <p>A gracious and evergreen city spread over seven hills, Thiruvananthapuram, capital of Kerala, is steeped in history and culture. Located in the extreme south of the state, its shores are washed by the warm waters of the Arabian Sea. This is a city where time moves gracefully with the day unfolding according to time honoured rhythms, qualities which make it one of the best cities in the country. Holding fort in the heart of the capital is Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple which is dedicated to Lord Vishnu who reclines on the serpent Anantha and after whom the city is named. Formerly called Trivandrum, the city’s original name was restored in 1991.As the visitor moves around the city he or she cannot fail to notice many traditional elements of Kerala culture that have been passed down from generations. From temple elephants swaggering down a street to traditionally dressed women and men as well as people eating off banana leaves, the sights are many and often found only in this part of the country.

Thiruvananthapuram is cutting edge too. The city occupies pride of place in India’s space research programme and is home to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre as well as several other institutions such as the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Technopark and the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management. Students from all over Kerala make a beeline for its many colleges and professional institutes to advance their prospects.

This salubrious city is today a magnet for tourists, businessmen and professionals. For many of them it captures the essence of Kerala and is an ideal springboard from which to venture into the rest of the state. The city sprang into the nation’s consciousness in 2011 with the discovery of a hoard of treasure at Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Hundreds of valuable items had accumulated over the centuries as gifts from the rulers of Travancore to the temple and is said to be worth over Rs 1 trillion. A rich legacy indeed!
